## 🚀 Project Overview

Learning Data Structures and Algorithms is often difficult because internal execution steps are hidden.  
This project solves that problem by providing **visual, interactive, and AI-assisted explanations** of algorithms.

The platform allows users to:
- Visualize algorithms step-by-step
- Understand recursion stacks, memory flow, and traversal logic
- Analyze time and space complexity
- Get AI-generated beginner-friendly explanations
- Practice problems from trusted platforms
